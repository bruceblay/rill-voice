// The ensemble keeps each device on the shared beat the way main.cpp does:
// every 120 ms it compares where the shared grid is with barPhase() and trims
// a quarter of the difference. Run that loop against a grid well off this
// engine's own, and the engine has to settle onto it and stay there. If
// barPhase() does not move with the trims, the same error is paid again and
// again and the trims never stop. Taps are part of it: a new piece has to
// begin on the grid it was on, not start one of its own.
// A tempo change, as the ensemble makes one: the shared grid takes the new
// tempo on a line, and the engine hears of it at its next 120 ms service.
// It has to stay on the grid through the change, not lose its place.
